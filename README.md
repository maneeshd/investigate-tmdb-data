# Inferential Statistics Project: Investigation of TMDb Dataset

***by Maneesh Divana for Udacity's Machine Learning Foundation Nanodegree***

-----


### Dataset: TMDb movie data (cleaned from original data on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata))

This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.


### Overview and Notes:

Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.
There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worry about cleaning them. You can leave them as is.
The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, 
accounting for inflation over time.
